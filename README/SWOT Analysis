Strengths: Strengths identify the plus points of the current way of how system is supposed to be built.
The following are the strengths:
<!-- Modularity:  -->
The project is ideated to be built using Java and Spring Boot, allowing for modular development and easy integration of new features, especially for seamless integration and scaling with cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP.
<!-- Object-Oriented Design: -->
The use of object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism promotes code reusability and maintainability.
<!-- Exception Handling: -->
Exception handling has been implemented to ensure robustness in the system and this marks for the base level implementation using private and protected access modifiers along with use of abstract classes and interfaces so as to implement rule-based implementation.
<!-- Database Interaction: -->
The application interacts with a database using JDBC, facilitating data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Also, it supports both local RDS or on-premise database and hybrid cloud burst techiques at times of heavy load and the shift happens automatically based on both environment and load.
<!-- Cloud Integration: -->
The application seamlessly integrates with AWS services such as RDS, CloudWatch, and ELB, enabling scalability, monitoring, and load balancing. Also, having renowned cloud partners helps the organisation widen its customer based through set up of pre-reliability levels.

Weaknesses: Weakness here marks for the current loopholes that exist or may exist in general and could be improved and also leaves a scope of improvement for the entire system.
The following are the weaknesses:
<!-- Limited Error Handling: -->
While exception handling is implemented, the error messages provided may not be accurately informative or detailed enough for troubleshooting or assistive in terms of implementing support measures.
<!-- Single Point of Failure: -->
This marks for a 'could have been a weakness.' Reliance on a single database instance (e.g., RDS) and lack of redundancy could lead to downtime in case of failure.
(Therefore, it becomes important to implement heartbeat datastores.)
<!-- Security Vulnerabilities: -->
Security vulnerabilities never gets evaded away completely. It is because just like white hat hackers, crackers too are never off their work, so timely and quick updates and upgrades are required.
<!-- Scalability Challenges: -->
Scaling the application may require significant effort, especially when dealing with high traffic or large datasets. Implementing scaling in microservices based architechture would be a better option.

Opportunities: Opportunities straight away refer to improvisation techniques and future scope that could led to increase the number of users of the system.
The opportunities are as follows:
<!-- Enhanced Monitoring: -->
Leveraging AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and other monitoring tools can provide insights into application performance, user behavior, and system health.
<!-- Improved Error Reporting: -->
Implementing comprehensive error logging and reporting mechanisms can facilitate troubleshooting and debugging.
<!-- Refactoring for Microservices: -->
Breaking down the application into microservices architecture can enhance scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.
<!-- Automated Testing: -->
Implementing automated testing frameworks such as JUnit or Mockito can streamline the testing process and improve code quality. Devops practices, if put in place could lead to a significant decrease in effort to carry out testing.
<!-- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): -->
Implementing CI/CD pipelines can automate the build, test, and deployment processes, enabling faster release cycles and reducing manual errors.

Threats: Threats account for the factors that are of paramount importance and must be taken care of attentively and if not taken care of, could lead to failure of product either due to competitive market or poor business profits.
The threats are as follows:
<!-- Competitive Pressure: -->
The ridesharing industry is highly competitive, with established players and new entrants constantly innovating and expanding their services.
<!-- Regulatory Compliance: -->
Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and transportation laws (e.g., licensing, insurance) may impose additional constraints and overhead.
<!-- Security Breaches: -->
Security vulnerabilities, data breaches, or cyberattacks could damage the reputation of the application and erode user trust.
<!-- Infrastructure Failures: -->
Dependencies on third-party services (e.g., AWS) and infrastructure failures (e.g., network outages, server downtime) could disrupt service availability and user experience.

Overall, by leveraging its strengths, addressing weaknesses, exploring opportunities, and mitigating threats, the project can enhance its technical capabilities, competitiveness, and resilience in the ridesharing market. A major achievement in the project will be successful fulfillment of both business and technical perspectives implemented thoroughly.
